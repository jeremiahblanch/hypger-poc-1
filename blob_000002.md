Gerald started his diner using a payout he engineered through murdering his wife with poisoned chips and steak. He couldn’t deny this new talent he’d discovered in himself (cooking, not poison), so he opened the restaurant. Six years on and it’s been doing great. He couldn’t be prouder. 

He’d secured the lease during construction of the highway rest area. Two big chains had funded the construction, and the council forced them to leave space for two small independent operators. Gerald had his name on Gerald’s Deluxe. A few years later he acquired a secret 30% interest in Kangaroo Tucker Box. The chains were preventing him, contractually at least, from serving burgers, fries or fried chicken, but he got around this by serving “deluxe rolls” and “fried potato slices”. He sliced the potato nice and thin for a better surface area to volume ratio. He’d never liked thick fries, you could taste the potato too much. His ex-wife liked them thick, which he always thought was strange. He’d rather not think about her, to be honest.

He’d moved back east to “turn over a new leaf” and “put the pain behind me” but surprisingly, the pain chased him. Pain seems to do that. He knew it moved quickly, hung around you and over you like a swarm of angry bees in a cartoon, but he just didn’t think there’d be much. She was awful, and yet, he hardly thought about the bad times. The trip to Margaret River, that time on the sand dunes, camping, when she fell in the river and he helped her peel the wet clothes off her body and he wrapped her in his jacket. She was so small, little teeth chattering, he held her tightly around her waist and blew his hot breath on her neck. He cradled her like a child and carried her back to the car where he laid towels down on the seat and turned on the heater. He warmed some tea in the billy and he brought her a mug. She huddled over it with a blanket on her head and he held his arm around her back. Her little shoulders didn’t even fill his hands. She was much smaller than him. Not heavy at all. That had made it easier. He knew he wouldn’t need much.

In some ways his father had been harder. The first time had failed and Dad had twigged that something wasn’t right, but people had long since stopped listening to him. He saw conspiracies everywhere and then, five minutes later, he’d forget them. He was on his way out, surely, but after 2 years of home nursing he hadn’t decayed nearly as much as Gerald had hoped. The equation was obvious: get it done with now, get the inheritance and move on with your life. It took a while to summon the courage. That was the difficult part. The overdosing wasn’t difficult because Dad insisted on taking his own medication. But he’d always insist he hadn’t already taken it so Gerald had to ration it into daily piles. One day he let him have five doses in an hour, and that was it. 

Dad didn’t hurt nearly as much as Paula. The good memories of Dad were from the past. Dad was a different person and so was Gerald. But Paula … When you fall in love and then it ends, you only remember the good things.

Actually, let’s rephrase that: when you fall in love and it ends and you still live together and she berates and undermines you every day and tells you you are the worst thing that ever happened to her, you don’t think about the good things. When you discover she was creating fake invoices and siphoning money and that is the only reason your contract cleaning business went under, you don’t think about the good things. When you discover she forged your name on a summons and sheriffs confiscate your car on the day you were going to your biggest supplier to negotiate an extension on their payment terms in person, you don’t think about the good things. But you pull yourself together. You buy a bottle of cheap blended vegetable oil and a bottle of peanut oil. You pour most of the vegetable oil in a public rubbish bin and then mix the peanut oil in at about 1 part to 2. You invite her over to dinner to try to “smooth things out”. You paste on a fake smile and hide her handbag (containing the epi-pen) in a cupboard when she isn’t looking. You’ve got about 5 tablespoons of the special oil and you use all of it to fry the chips and the sausages. You boil some peas. You don’t have any butter for them and she gets annoyed and you tell her you’ll go to the servo to get some. You remember that feeling you used to have: how good it felt to make her feel special. You let it consume you one last time and tell her lovingly to start eating before the chips get cold; don’t wait for me. You get in the car and drive off, and let your wife’s greatest fear: that she might be powerless to prevent her own death from the allergy she was ever vigilant in defending herself against - that ever present fear that had driven her to be the force-of-will that she was, you let that fear consume her in her final twisting moments. That’s what you do. That’s the Rubicon you overcome to reach the next level of being. It feels good once you get there. 

But she’ll leave a mess of the living room when you come home from the petrol station.

Later, after the coroner’s court and the ambulance chasing lawyers and the out-of-court settlement with the oil distributor, you start to remember the good things again. Life goes on. Well, yours does anyway.
