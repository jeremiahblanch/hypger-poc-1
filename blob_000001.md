The blood of Genghis Khan the conqueror runs through me. It runs through you too but it runs through me more and that’s why I am sitting here telling you and you are sitting there hearing me.

And so, as always, it begins. Always begins. Always ends.

Either way you change it from what it was before. And that’s where you are. Don’t try to measure it.
